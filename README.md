# Mercedes-Benz Equity Analysis: A Multi-Method Valuation Framework
Overview
This repository contains my equity research project analyzing Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG), developed during my Investment Research Analyst internship at Strategic Global Advisors. The project combines traditional fundamental valuation techniques with a novel GenAI-enhanced approach to price target validation.

The analysis culminated in a stock pitch presentation that generated sufficient conviction among senior analysts to pursue deeper due diligence on the investment thesis.

Project Objectives
Conduct comprehensive fundamental analysis of Mercedes-Benz using industry-standard valuation methodologies
Develop traditional DCF and DDM models to establish intrinsic value estimates
Build a novel risk-scoring mechanism for price target validation as an alternative to traditional model-dependent approaches
Leverage GenAI tools to enhance thesis development, challenge assumptions, and stress-test the investment narrative
Synthesize findings into a compelling, defensible stock pitch
Valuation Methodologies
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
The DCF model estimates intrinsic value by projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back to present value. This approach answers the question: "What is the company worth based on the cash it will generate?"

Key components built:

Revenue projections based on segment analysis (Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Mercedes-Benz Mobility)
Operating margin assumptions informed by historical performance and industry trends
Capital expenditure and working capital forecasts
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) calculation incorporating:
Cost of equity (via CAPM)
Cost of debt (based on current borrowing rates)
Target capital structure
Terminal value estimation using perpetuity growth method
Sensitivity analysis across discount rates and growth assumptions
Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
The DDM values a stock based on the present value of expected future dividends. This approach is particularly relevant for Mercedes-Benz given its history of consistent dividend payments and commitment to shareholder returns.

Key components built:

Historical dividend analysis and payout ratio trends
Dividend growth rate projections (multi-stage model)
Cost of equity calculation
Gordon Growth Model implementation for terminal value
Scenario analysis across dividend growth assumptions
Price Target Risk-Scoring Mechanism (Novel Approach)
Traditional valuation models like DCF and DDM are highly sensitive to input assumptions — small changes in growth rates or discount rates can dramatically swing the output. This creates false precision and makes it difficult to assess confidence in price targets.

I developed an alternative framework that assigns probability-weighted risk scores to a vector of price targets, providing a more nuanced view of valuation uncertainty.

How it works:

Generate a range of price targets based on varying input assumptions
Assign probability weights to each scenario based on likelihood
Calculate expected value and confidence intervals
Score overall risk based on distribution characteristics (variance, skewness, tail risk)
Compare risk-adjusted targets against current market price
Why this matters:

Acknowledges uncertainty rather than hiding it in point estimates
Provides a framework for comparing conviction levels across investment ideas
Offers an independent validation layer that doesn't rely solely on model outputs
GenAI-Enhanced Analysis
A key differentiator of this project was the systematic integration of GenAI tools throughout the research process. Rather than using AI as a shortcut, I developed a structured prompt library to enhance rigor and challenge my own thinking.

Applications:
Thesis Development & Ideation

Industry analysis and competitive positioning
Identification of key value drivers and risk factors
Generation of alternative investment narratives to stress-test assumptions
Assumption Validation

Cross-referencing growth assumptions against industry benchmarks
Identifying potential blind spots in the investment thesis
Generating bear case scenarios and counterarguments
Research Synthesis

Summarizing earnings calls and management commentary
Extracting key metrics from financial filings
Identifying sentiment shifts in analyst coverage
Presentation Refinement

Structuring the narrative arc of the stock pitch
Anticipating likely pushback questions from senior analysts
Refining language for clarity and impact
Prompt Library
The /prompts folder contains the GenAI prompts I developed and refined throughout this project, organized by use case. These represent a reusable framework for AI-enhanced equity research.

Key Findings
Note: Specific price targets and recommendations are omitted to protect proprietary analysis.

The analysis identified Mercedes-Benz as a compelling opportunity based on:

Undervaluation relative to intrinsic value estimates across multiple methodologies
Strong free cash flow generation supporting dividend sustainability
Strategic positioning in luxury EV transition
Margin resilience despite industry headwinds
Attractive risk/reward profile based on probability-weighted scenario analysis
The investment thesis was presented to senior analysts and portfolio managers, resulting in further due diligence and deeper examination of the opportunity.
